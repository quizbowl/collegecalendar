This map aims to portray the typical size of the college quizbowl circuit at a glance. 
(No actual data is being plotted here;
regions and points are guesses based on attendance at recent tournaments (circa December 2025).
Please submit errata to the [GitHub repository](/about/).)

The geographic regions represented on this map are not intended to be normative in any way.
This site only uses them to roughly list tournaments on the calendar by region.
