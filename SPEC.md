This page documents the plain-text data files used to generate the calendar and map pages of this website.

## Season calendar

The layout of the main calendar pages (which contains the large tables) is generated by the template `_layouts/year.html`. It hard-codes some values, but generally does not need to be changed.

The order of tournaments within each part of a year (e.g. Fall or Spring) is defined in <code>_data/sets/<i>‹year›</i>/seasons.yaml</code>.

Information about each set is stored in a separate YAML file in the <code>_data/sets/<i>‹year›</i>/</code> folder. The following list of keys are supported:

Key | Description | Example
-|-|-
`name`        | Name of the set                      | `EFT 2017`
`fullname`    | Full name of the set                 | `Early Fall Tournament 2017`
`slot`        | Name of the standard slot            | `“Fall Medium 1”`
`prev`        | List of sets previously in this slot | `[EFT 2016, MFT, PADAWAN, IFT]`
`producedby`  | Who is producing the set (not shown) | `ACF`
`diff`        | Difficulty name                      | `Medium`
`diffdots`    | Difficulty rating                    | `●●`
`diffd2`      | Difficulty name in Division II       | `Easy`
`diffdotsd2`  | Difficulty rating in Division II     | `●`
`eligible`    | Eligibility details                  | `Closed`
`submission`  | Packet submission details            | `Required`
`announced`   | Date of global announcement          | `2017-03-23`
`announceurl` | URL of global announcement           | `https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=19786`
`firstonline` | Date of first online mirror          | `2017-09-16`
`firstmirror` | Date of first mirror                 | `2017-09-30`
`speculative` | Indicates `firstmirror` is freeform  | `yes`
`firstideal`  | Date of first ideal mirror           | `2017-10-19`
`lastideal`   | Date of last ideal mirror            | `2017-10-26`
`mirrors`     | List of mirrors                      | `{ date: 2017-09-30, region: 1A, name: Yale,` <br /> `eligible: HS, cancelled: yes, url: "..." }`
`clear`       | Date when the set is clear           | `2018-01-23`
`reallyclear` | Is the set confirmed to be clear     | `yes`
`ebol`        | Is the set participating in EBOL     | `no`
`packetsurl`  | URL to packets on archive            | `https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/2048/`

Dates may be `TBD`. If `speculative` is non-empty, the value for `firstmirror` will be interpreted as freeform text instead of a date, allowing for provisional detail when the date is not exactly known (e.g. `"late February"`, `"either 2/3 or 2/4"`, `"likely 11/20"`).

In general, blank values are used when reliable information does not yet exist. The value for `clear` can be a future date if it is strongly assumed, but should later be changed to match the actual date when the set became clear.

Mirrors should generally be ordered in the source file canonically by date (weekend) and then by region, with playtest mirrors first and HS mirrors at the end, unless there is a good reason to order them in another manner.

Mirror names (i.e. college or school names) should generally remain consistent with existing convention in this repository. A guiding principle for mirror names is to be short enough to not wrap onto two lines when displayed in the main table, but not be overly abbreviated.

## Regions

Information about the geographic regions is stored in `map/regions.js`. The two-letter region IDs are also defined by `_layouts/year.html`, but this duplication will eventually be removed.
For convenience, the regions are listed below:

ID | Region
-- | --
0P | Online playtest
0L | Online
1A | New England
1B | New York
2A | N. Mid-Atlantic
2B | S. Mid-Atlantic
3A | Upper South
3B | Deep South
3C | Florida
4A | Texas/Louisiana
4B | Southwest
5A | S. California
5B | N. California
6A | Pacific Northwest
6B | Rocky Mountains
7A | Great Plains
7B | Missouri
8A | Upper Midwest
8B | Central Midwest
8C | Eastern Midwest
CA | Canada
UK | UK
AS | Asia

## Circuit map

Information about the colleges on the circuit map is stored in `map/colleges.tsv`.

It is a tab-separated values (TSV) file, so tab characters must be used as delimiters.
The columns are as follows:

Key | Description | Example
-|-|-
`region`               | Region code | `1A`
`active`               | Club activity status<br />(2 = hosts, 1 = attends, 0 = inactive, 3 = primarily online) | `1`
`city`                 | City        | `Storrs`
`state`                | State       | `CT`
`country`              | Country     | `USA`
`lat`                  | Latitude    | `41.807741`
`long`                 | Longitude   | `-72.253981`
`college_abbr`         | Abbreviated name (e.g. an acronym) | `UConn`
`college`              | Common name (unambiguous) | `Connecticut`
`college_long`         | Full name   | `University of Connecticut`

The region geometries defined in `map/regions.js` refer to TopoJSON polygons (by FIPS codes, CDUIDs, etc.) from `map/us.json`, `map/canada.json`, and `map/uk.json`.

For `active`, mark the expected status over 5 years (i.e. 1 tournament in 5 years does not qualify as an active host). High schools are not mapped as they are not part of a college circuit. Create an issue if interested in setting/leading mapping guidance. Sort nearby colleges by `active` in descending order (so that smaller dots overlap on top of larger dots).
